\usage{
trainModel(
  modelData,
  algorithm = "brt",
  hyperparameters = NULL,
  monotonicity = NULL
)
}
\description{
Trains a specified Species Distribution Model algorithm (GLM, BRT, MaxEnt, XGBoost)
using data prepared with cross-validation folds and repetitions (e.g., by
\code{generateModelData}). It performs hyperparameter tuning via grid search,
selecting the best parameters for each fold/repetition based on AUC performance
on the validation set. It then retrains a final model for each fold/repetition
on combined training and validation data using the best parameters. Test performance
is evaluated using an ensemble (average) prediction from all repetition models within a fold.
Finally, it aggregates performance metrics across folds.
