\title{Calculate and Plot Variable Importance from Model Ensemble}
\usage{
variableContribution(models, rasterLayers)
}
\description{
Extracts or calculates variable importance scores from a list of fitted model
objects (typically generated by \code{trainModel}). It calculates the mean and
standard error of importance across the ensemble and generates a bar plot.
Note: Importance metrics are algorithm-specific (e.g., relative influence for
GBM, Gain for XGBoost, absolute coefficient for GLM). Maxent importance is not
calculated by this function (requires permutation).
