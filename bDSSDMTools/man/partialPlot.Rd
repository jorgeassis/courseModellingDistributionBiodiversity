\title{Generate Partial Dependence Plot (Response Curve)}
\usage{
partialPlot(model, modelData, variablePlot)
}
\description{
Calculates and plots the partial dependence (response curve) for a specified
predictor variable from an ensemble of models. It shows how the predicted
suitability (averaged across models) changes across the observed range of the
chosen variable, while holding other predictor variables constant at their mean
values. Optionally calculates potential threshold/tipping points. Includes a
rug plot showing the distribution of the variable for presence points.
