### Scope

Provide students training in the scope of macroecology and species distribution modeling to infer and discuss the interactions and potential impacts of global climate changes on marine biodiversity.

The course is mostly hands-on oriented, with a strong component on biodiversity and climatic data acquisition, management and visualisation (e.g., the new Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios of climate change), as well as on modeling frameworks using state of the art algorithms (e.g., machine learning).

### Target audience

The course is targeted to PhD students in the fields of marine biology, ecology, conservation and evolution. Students must be fluent in English and have some basic knowledge on marine ecology, statistics and R computing language (although not mandatory). Students are highly encouraged to bring their own datasets (if data are not available, the professor will provide own data).

### Learning outcomes

**Knowledge**  
The candidate should:
- Be at the forefront of knowledge within the academic field of biodiversity modelling
- Have theoretical knowledge of major aspects of how the environment and climate change affects biodiversity,  
- Be able to understand and communicate current theory and information related to the effect of macroscale environmental conditions and climate change on biodiversity 
- Be able of judging the implications of research methods and processes, and to understand how biodiversity does and will respond to changing environmental conditions and climate.
 
**Skills** 
The candidate should be able to:
- Extract, manage and visualize marine biodiversity and bioclimatic data;
- Use niche theory to develop mechanistic and correlative (e.g., machine learning) bioclimatic models;
- Discuss the strengths and limitations of bioclimatic models at biogeographical scales, as well as the concept of transferability across space and time;
- Discuss good practice bioclimatic modelling for proper parameterization and evaluation of predictive performances;
- Integrate physiological information into hybrid modelling to improve transferability;
- Project the potential consequences of global climate changes to marine biodiversity;
- Predict potential invasive processes;
- Use ecological niche overlap analyses to infer potential drivers of niche evolution and diversification.
- Discuss the results of bioclimatic modelling and the impacts of climate change on the distribution and evolutionary processes of marine biodiversity, and defend them to a wide audience (e.g., publishing scientific manuscripts and technical reports).


**General competence**
The candidate should:
- Be able to disseminate and communicate the research field of climate change effects on biodiversity through appropriate national and international channels to ensure knowledge-sharing with the community at large
- Be able to communicate how past and future predictions of the geographic and environmental distribution of aspects of biodiversity can and have been researched
- Be able to engage in debates on how climate influences biodiversity and biogeography in relevant forums
- Share knowledge and protect it where necessary following internationally accepted guidelines and regulations

### Individual research study
The course includes an individual research study, which is a mandatory component of the course. The individual research study is designed to provide students with the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills acquired during the course to a specific research question related to (1) the interactions or (2) impacts of global climate changes on marine biodiversity.

The students can choose one of the following topics:

- Identify the main climatic drivers shaping the distribution of one or more marine species
 - Predict present distributional ranges for one or more marine species
- Project future range shifts for one or more marine species
- Predict potential marine invasion processes for one or more marine species
- Additional topics can be proposed (in such case, please contact the professor)

To successfully conduct the individual research study, the students must perform the following tasks:

- Gather biodiversity data for one or more marine species;
- Gather environmental data to model the distribution of one or more marine species;
- Model the distribution of one or more marine species;
- Write an R Markdown report ([template](https://github.com/jorgeassis/courseModellingDistributionBiodiversity/tree/main/Code%20recipes)) with the following format:
	Abstract: What was done in a nutshell (Max. 250 words);
	Introduction: Brief statement on what is the problem (Max. 500 words);
	Methods: Brief statement on how the problem was solved (Max. 500 words);
	Code to perform modelling and the main Figures;
	Results: Brief statement on what was found out (Max. 500 words);
	Discussion: Brief statement on what it means (Max. 250 words);
	References: Whose work was referred.
	
To successfully write the report, the students must:

- Formulate a relevant research ecological question, in the scope of climate change impacts (e.g., what will be the consequences of future climate to Zostera noltii?);
- Formulate an hypothesis, based on the general theories presented in the lectures or from the course literature (e.g., increasing emissions of greenhouse gases will produce more severe range shifts to Zostera noltii.);
- Formulate a conceptual model to address the question in their system (e.g., Zostera noltii is a seagrass species that is distributed along the Atlantic coast of Europe. It is expected to be affected by climate change, particularly by increasing sea surface temperatures and decreasing salinity. The model will include these variables as predictors of the species distribution.);
- Formulate a statistical model to test the hypothesis (e.g., a correlative model will be fitted to the data);
- Read literature in a systematic way to assess the evidence for the different components of their models and hypothesis, and formulate conclusions and recommendations.
